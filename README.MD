Insights: 

In analyzing the data, the following insights were drawn:

Demographics Analysis-

•	There are three countries France, Spain and Germany. France has the highest number of customers with Spain and Germany at near equal distribution of customers
•	There are more male(54.5%) than female (45.4%)customers by gender distribution across the geographical locations.
•	The customer distribution by age, presents very young customer segment with significant distributions between 25years and 45years.  There is a peak at about 35years for about 35% of the Bank customers. This is a significant audience and requires marketing and products tailored to attract the younger generation. 
Considering the customer decrease after 50years, how may the bank position to retain customers longer than 40-45years.(Premium retirement packages, Mortgage opportunities for first time home buyers, Travel and insurance targeted products)

Customer Engagement Patterns-

•	Out of 10,000 customers across three regions, 51% of the customers own credit cards with 28% of them male customers and 22% of the female customers own credit cards. There is an untapped 49% market target in credit card products for the young demographics of customers. Drive and increase credit card sales strategies to increase customer engagement with products. 

Financial Performance:
•	The credit score for both genders’ peaks between 600 and 700, with the females having better credit ratings than male. 
Exited Customers Analysis:

•	France has the highest retention rate than exited customer. Germany would benefit from business and marketing strategies that speaks to Customer retention to reduce the exit rate.
•	Overall on the Exit Status by gender, More Men than women are actively retained within the bank with a slightly higher margin of women exiting more than Men.

The matrix for Tenure, No of products and Credit Score are all relatively independent.
There is no linear relationship between Tenure, No of products and CreditScore. The tenure of a customer does not necessarily tie to No of products or affect the credit score

Conclusions and Recommendations.

•	The bank has a very young customer segment with the peak at 35years. More products that are likely to keep them retained to increase retention beyond 50years of age will be beneficial.  Retirement packaged accounts, rewarding long term mortgage plans(with first time buyer rewards), Travel credit cards, insurance products will be beneficial to this audience to increase engagement and retain them for longer Tenure. 
•	The data shows that women will be a good target for credit card sales. 
Build partnerships with female related companies like beauty stores, Kids clothing stores, Fashion companies or even schools to increase 
•	We need to work with Germany to see the peculiarity of their audience, what is France doing differently to retain more customers. 
•	We have two outliers with very high balance. We need to investigate his unique information to know how we might increase more high-balance customers.
